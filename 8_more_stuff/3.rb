# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# Me: Exception handling tells the program what to do when an exception is raised. This has the benefit of making sure the program doesn't break when an error occurs. 

# LS: Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program. It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
